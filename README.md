**Teacher:** Javi Brines

Tis readme intents to explain the second lab in the SCAV subject for the video part.

This repository consists in:

**Pdf:** Pdf file containing screenshots of exercises with results.

**Python exercises:** Containing the code for all the different exercises needed to compute this lab. Run *ex5* containing the menu of all the lab for a full experience. Run each exercise independently if desired.

**ex1:** For the first exercise we access, through ffprobe, the characteristics of our 10 sec video. As can be seen in the images, the 3 characteristics collected have been the resolution, the video codec and the number of frames.

**ex2:** Using the *rename* function through the *os.system*, we can rename the video file to an ooutput name especified previously by the user. 

-   **WARNING!!!** If you try to run this exercise, it will give an error, since I have not uploaded the        videos of each resolution.

**ex3:** For this exercise, we empower the user. Which can enter the desired resolution to change the bbb_video.mp4 video using command line.

**ex4:** Using the videos uploaded in *Aula Global*, containing the infromation about the containers seen in class, we transcode our video into one of this.

**ex5:** Contains a little simple menu which is characterized by a 'switch' with different options based on which exercise you want to perform.
